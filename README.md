GreenGrub is an AI-based solution designed to classify fruits and vegetables as fresh or rotten using computer vision. Built to support food distribution networks, the model helps automate quality checks at various stagesâ€”from farms to warehouses and food processing units.

ðŸ§  Built with TensorFlow, KerasCV, and MobileNetv2

ðŸ“Š Custom data pipeline with image augmentation for better generalization

âœ… Real-time classification to support sorting, reuse, or composting decisions

ðŸ”„ Designed for integration into supply chain workflows to reduce food waste

GreenGrub aims to make agriculture and food tech smarter, more efficient, and sustainable.
In order to run this, you need install a local LLM (Ollama) and pull a model first like llama 3 or gemma:2b.
Then pull it using : ollama pull model_name
Then run the app.py file
That's it .
